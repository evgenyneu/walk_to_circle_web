      <h2>Feedback</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Evgenii and I’m the creator of the Walk To Circle application.
        You can reach me at <a href="http://evgenii.com">evgenii.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I made this app</h2>

      <p>You have to ask yourself exactly what you want out of your daily, every other day, or possibly evening walks? Are you looking for an escape from the business of life? Are you seeking adventure? Do you want to discover those things you wouldn’t ordinarily see on your normal, everyday path?</p>

      <p>The reason for designing this walking application is pretty simple. I am one who definitely enjoys walking, every chance I get. For the longest time I had wanted to develop something that would allow others to find more satisfaction with walking. After all, walking can become quite boring, especially if you walk the same beaten paths day in and day out.</p>

      <h2>Enjoy Your Daily Walk The Way You Want It</h2>

      <p>The Walk To Circle app is your friendly guide for discovering new paths and gaining new visual experiences! There is no distraction to keep you from focusing on the path you choose to follow. The circle drops in on the screen for a brief moment, illustrating where you should go to start. All that is required is for you to memorize the location and get to stepping! This is where the true test comes in!</p>

      <p>If you have good memorization skills then there’ll be no problem with remembering where the circle was situated when you looked at it. The app won’t allow you to go back and see it again so you simply must walk in the direction you feel it was placed.</p>

      <h2>A Delightful Way To Get Everyone Outdoors And Moving</h2>

      <p>Let me say this to all of my readers once again—the sole goal is to have fun folks! I created my app so you could get out and really explore. If you can have the opportunity to hone in on your walk and the sights and sounds around you, you’ll be able to gain some serious relaxation from your experience! This is all at your leisure so there is no score to beat and no competitions to out do.</p>

      <p>I do have to tell you, using the GPS of the iPhone for this entertaining activity will utilize the battery life. You can <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/walk-to-circle/id955310614'>download this app</a> for free and start a new walking experience immediately! It is my hope you really enjoy this and I’d love to <a href="http://evgenii.com">hear back</a> on what you think!</p>
